If you don't have internet access on your Linux machine and you can only transfer files via Samba, updating Emacs might be a bit tricky, especially if you don't have root access. However, it's still possible to update Emacs manually if you have the necessary permissions to install software in your user directory.

Here's a general outline of what you can do:

1. **Download Emacs**: On a machine with internet access, download the Emacs source tarball for version 29.2 from the official GNU Emacs website or a trusted mirror. You can use `wget` or any web browser for this task.

2. **Transfer Emacs Tarball**: Transfer the downloaded Emacs tarball to your Linux machine via Samba.

3. **Extract Emacs Tarball**: On your Linux machine, extract the contents of the Emacs tarball to a directory where you have write permissions. You can do this using the `tar` command. For example:
   ```
   tar -xvf emacs-29.2.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Compile Emacs**: Change to the directory where you extracted the Emacs source code and follow the standard procedure for compiling Emacs. Typically, this involves running the `configure`, `make`, and `make install` commands. However, since you don't have root access, you might need to specify a prefix where Emacs will be installed to a directory where you have write permissions. For example:
   ```
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/local
   make
   make install
   ```

5. **Update PATH**: After installation, ensure that the directory where Emacs was installed (`$HOME/local/bin` if you used the above example) is in your `PATH` environment variable. You can do this by modifying your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

6. **Test Emacs**: Open a new terminal window and type `emacs` to verify that the updated Emacs version is being used.

Please note that updating software without root access might have limitations, and you might encounter issues with dependencies or conflicting versions. If you face any problems during the installation process, you may need to resolve them manually or seek assistance from someone with administrative privileges on the Linux machine.
