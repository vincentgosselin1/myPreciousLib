Updating software on a machine without internet access can be a bit tricky, especially if you don't have root access. However, it's not impossible. Here's a general outline of how you might go about updating Emacs on your Linux machine:

1. **Download Emacs on a machine with internet access**: 
   On a different machine that has internet access, download the Emacs 29.2 source code tarball from the official Emacs website or a trusted mirror.

2. **Transfer the Emacs tarball to your Linux machine**:
   Since you have access to Samba, you can transfer the Emacs tarball from the machine where you downloaded it to your Linux machine using Samba file sharing. Place it in a directory where you have write permissions.

3. **Extract the Emacs tarball**:
   Once the tarball is on your Linux machine, extract its contents using the `tar` command. For example:
   ```
   tar -xvf emacs-29.2.tar.gz
   ```

4. **Build Emacs from source**:
   Navigate to the directory where you extracted the Emacs source code and follow the standard build process:
   ```
   cd emacs-29.2
   ./configure
   make
   ```

5. **Install Emacs locally**:
   Since you mentioned you might not have root access, you can install Emacs locally without administrative privileges. You can specify the installation directory using the `--prefix` option with `configure`. For example:
   ```
   ./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
   make install
   ```
   This will install Emacs in `$HOME/.local` directory.

6. **Update your PATH**:
   After installation, make sure to add the Emacs binary directory to your PATH so that you can run the newly installed version. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`):
   ```
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   ```
   Then, either source the configuration file (`source ~/.bashrc`) or restart your shell for the changes to take effect.

7. **Verify the installation**:
   You can now verify that Emacs has been successfully installed by running:
   ```
   emacs --version
   ```

This process should allow you to update Emacs to version 29.2 on your Linux machine without internet access and potentially without root access.
