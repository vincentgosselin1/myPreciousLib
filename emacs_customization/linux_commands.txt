#Copying a bunch of modified files from one SVN repository to another can be streamlined by identifying the changed files and copying only those.
#List Modified Files in the Source Repository
svn status | grep '^M' | awk '{print $2}' > modified_files.txt
#Copy Modified Files to the Destination Repository
xargs -a modified_files.txt -I {} cp --parents {} ../repo2/
